# Delegate v2 compatibility contract

## Status and rule

This is the v2 rewrite boundary extracted from v1's README, schemas, ADR,
context glossary, and tests. “Preserve” means callers and operators can rely on
the semantic outcome.

V1 implementation details are explicitly non-binding. Its module boundaries,
algorithms, event-loop heuristics, timeout constants, lock structure, ticket
state machinery, temporary-index strategy, worktree/ref/patch representation,
database layout, and test seams do not become v2 requirements merely because
they were necessary in v1.

Any departure from the preserve list is a deliberate breaking change and needs
release notes and migration guidance; it must not arrive as rewrite drift.

## v2 preserves

### Calls and configuration

- The four modes, their top-level selectors, dispatch-wide `async`, canonical
  task fields, closed enum values, and batch-before-start validation described
  in `SPEC.md`.
- Defensive normalization of stringified tasks, flat task calls, string tools,
  and empty agent names.
- Top-level-only session RPC. Task-level `async` and `sessionAction`, legacy
  `action`, and unsafe-write bypasses remain rejected (all of them — see the
  breaking-change entry below).
- `default`, `scout`, `coder`, and `reviewer` semantics; task-over-profile
  precedence; Markdown discovery order and first-definition wins.
- User-global `delegate.json` configuration. Project files do not become
  delegate configuration.
- Parent model inheritance and project instructions and extension isolation, including verified
  provider-scoped exceptions and the meanings of `*` and `ro`, subject to the
  model-selection and parent-history departures below.

### Execution and state

- Input-ordered sync results, bounded global/per-model concurrency, cooperative
  cancellation, retry accounting, and compaction-inclusive usage accounting.
- Live host-lifetime sessions keyed by `sessionId`; durable recovery through
  explicit `.jsonl` `resumeFrom`, not automatic pool recovery after restart.
- Frozen session configuration, same-ID serialization, insert-on-success,
  explicit close, and parent-shutdown cleanup.
- Async fire-and-forget tickets, poll/wait/cancel/pause/resume behavior,
  idempotent settlement, retained results, and session-tree leaf-aware delivery
  as specified in `SPEC.md` "Background delivery".
- Operation on a stock, unmodified Pi installation through its public
  extension API. Requiring a patched, forked, or unreleased Pi host is a
  breaking change, not an implementation detail.
- Pause as a cooperative boundary between tasks/model turns—not OS process
  suspension—and continued counting of explicit deadlines.

### Workspaces and safety

- `shared` edits the source tree; `scratch` discards a reflink copy;
  `isolated` reconciles Git proposals. Scratch and isolated remain one-shot and
  are not advertised as security boundaries.
- Fail-closed shared-write admission, canonical overlap rules, unknown tools as
  writers, same-call serialization, and cross-call rejection.
- Isolated preservation of dirty/untracked baseline state and the user's
  branch/index; task-order, all-or-nothing application; retained conflict and
  cancellation artifacts; `applied_unverified` wording.
- The safe-reuse, safe-cleanup, and quarantine outcomes in `INVARIANTS.md`;
  v1's quiescence-barrier algorithm is not preserved.

### Signals and data

- Actionable errors that preserve the relevant correction, even if wording
  changes.
- Aggregate usage on synchronous tool results where supported. Async delivered
  messages still cannot add usage to the parent total.
- Optional duplicate-safe dispatch identity (`operationId`, issue #16): an
  additive contract — a keyed call with the same normalized request reuses
  the original in-flight or settled result, and a keyed call with a changed
  request conflicts. This is not content deduplication — unkeyed dispatches
  always execute — and not an exactly-once crash/restart guarantee —
  identity is host-lifetime only with bounded retention.
- Opt-in, fail-open local telemetry that never stores prompt/output content,
  with stable call/task outcome meaning and explicit migration or versioning
  for existing databases. Telemetry stays disabled unless the user sets
  `telemetry.enabled: true` in `delegate.json`; v2 records only dispatch and
  outcome metadata for batches that reach a completed outcome — the batch
  start timestamp and wall duration, sync/async mode, task count, terminal call
  status, caller-visible task status, agent/model/thinking/tools/workspace
  selections, integration status, retry count, and numeric token/cost usage —
  plus caller-visible task outcomes with unconfirmed-quiescence rows marked
  provisional — and never prompt, system-prompt, output or error text, cwd or
  session paths, caller task IDs, operation IDs, or parent transcript content.
  Existing databases migrate in place and existing rows are preserved; legacy
  sensitive fields are not continued on new v2 rows, and v2 leaves the legacy
  per-task duration column NULL.

## v2 deliberate breaking changes

- **Parent conversation sharing removed (#14, user decision).** No parent
  transcript extraction or injection remains. The task `context` field is no
  longer advertised or accepted: all supplied values, including `fresh`, reject
  the entire batch before any task starts. This deliberately replaces the old
  `with-parent-transcript` capability, not just its failure fallback.
  Migration: omit `context` and provide a self-contained task brief. Existing
  `context: "fresh"` callers must also omit the field; their intended freshness
  is now unconditional relative to the parent. Project instructions, model
  inheritance, child-owned pooled sessions and explicit `resumeFrom` remain.

- **Mixed-outcome async batches settle as `partial` (#6, user decision).**
  A naturally settled batch where at least one task succeeded and at least
  one did not now reports terminal `partial` instead of v1's implicit
  `completed` — a partially failed batch must never look like a clean
  success. `completed` means every task succeeded, `failed` means no task
  succeeded and at least one failed, and `cancelled` means every task was
  cancelled or the ticket was force-cancelled, which stays authoritative over
  late outcomes.
  Migration: treat `partial` as terminal like `completed`, and inspect the
  per-task outcomes for the failures instead of trusting the headline.

- **Unknown singular ticket RPCs are errors (#6, user decision).** Poll
  with a ticket id, wait, cancel, pause, and resume on a missing id now
  return a tool error naming the ticket instead of a successful "not
  found" response — a lookup miss must never read as success. Roster
  polling without a ticket id is unchanged and still succeeds with an
  empty or populated list.
  Migration: handle singular misses as tool errors; do not rely on
  scanning response text for "not found".

Departures from the preserve list above. Each must carry its own motivation
and migration guidance; none may arrive as silent rewrite drift.

- **Unavailable parent tools fail closed for default-profile inheritance.**
  A throwing active-tool probe no longer silently falls back to writer tools.
  If any `default` task omits `tools`, the whole sync or async call rejects
  before children start, with a logged, actionable error preserving the cause.
  Migration: restore the parent's tool inventory or supply an intentional
  explicit `tools` list (including `[]`) on every affected task. Explicit-tool,
  scout/coder/reviewer, and inline dispatches do not probe the inventory;
  their existing capabilities are unchanged.

- **Task `model` field removed; models are user-configured only.** V1
  resolved any registry-resolvable model reference (including
  `:thinking`-suffixed ones) the caller cared to type, letting a subagent
  spend on any model in the registry — and callers are reliably bad at
  picking models (stale training-data names, wrong cost tier). V2 tasks
  carry no model selection at all. Inline tasks and the `default` profile
  mirror the parent's model unconditionally — inheritance is the invariant,
  not a configurable, and `models.default` is rejected at config load. A
  *named agent* runs on the model the user assigned it under `"models"` in
  the user-global `delegate.json` (object: agent name → reference), else the
  parent's model. A task `model` field is rejected before tasks start with
guidance toward the config; a configured reference that does not resolve in
  the session's registry fails the same way, naming the entry.
  Migration: move any per-task model choice into `delegate.json`
  `"models"` — e.g. `{"scout": "<provider/model-id>"}` with references
  taken from your actual configured models; callers stop sending `model`. The
  model-failure recovery hint now addresses the operator, not the caller.

- **Operator unsafe-write bypass not carried (user decision, 2026-09-21).**
  V1's `"allowUnsafeSharedWrites"` escape hatch is gone: no operator or
  caller setting can skip admission, and `INVARIANTS.md` now forbids one
  outright. Unguarded shared-tree running remains reachable only through
  deliberate workspace choices — sequential shared batches or parallel
  `isolated` edits. Reintroduction would be a new contract change, not a
  restoration of this one.
  Migration: delete `"allowUnsafeSharedWrites"` from `delegate.json`. V2
  silently ignores unknown top-level config keys, so leaving it changes
  nothing — but the warn-while-active unguarded mode it enabled is no
  longer possible at all.

- **V1 per-agent override maps and housekeeping config keys are not read
  (2026-09-21 reconciliation).**
  `agentOverrides`, `agentOverridesByParentModel`, `maxAsyncTickets`, and
  `output.spillThresholdChars`/`output.spillTailChars` have no v2 meaning; stale entries
  are silently ignored. Model choice for named agents lives only under
  user-global `"models"`; per-agent `thinking`/`tools` preferences are
  task fields today and agent Markdown frontmatter once named profiles
  land (#7), keeping their v1 precedence below task fields. Async tickets
  are uncapped in count and live for the host lifetime: `concurrency`
  bounds execution, not ticket creation, and settled tickets stay pollable
  until the host exits.
  Migration: express per-agent thinking/tools as task fields now
  (frontmatter later); drop the stale keys; rely on concurrency bounds and
  polling rather than a ticket cap or TTL sweep.

## v2 deferred capabilities (not dropped)

These v1 capabilities are intentionally absent from v2 today — sequenced
with the approved roadmap, not cancelled. No tool operation or field
semantics change while they are absent; each is owned by an issue.

- **Operator-visibility layer (#24)** — shipped 2026-09-22: the footer
  status line, the once-per-ticket settle warning, the switch/fork consent
  guards, the quit/reload abort traces, and the live subagent browser
  (`/subagents`, Ctrl+Shift+B). Still deferred with #24: the
  tree-navigation consent prompt (its safety half is already covered by
  leaf-aware delivery — non-waking append at the current leaf), live rows
  for in-flight sync dispatches (finished sync calls are retained; a
  deliberate divergence from v1's live sync view), per-call RUNNING/DONE
  tool markers, and agent names in the shutdown summary (ids only today).
- **Large-output bounding (#25)** — v1 spilled subagent final outputs past
  8 000 chars to a temp file and rendered a 2 000-char tail with a
  pointer, keeping the full text in result details. V2 currently renders
  the complete output in the caller-visible result text unbounded; very
  large subagent answers enter the parent context whole.

## Known host limitations (accepted 2026-09-19, issue #3)

These follow from Pi's public extension API and are documented rather than
worked around with a host modification.

- **Ordered lifecycle handlers.** Pi awaits `session_shutdown` and
  `session_before_tree` handlers one extension at a time. If an extension
  loaded before Delegate awaits in its handler, a ticket settling in that
  window is delivered before Delegate learns of the transition and may trigger
  one turn on the outgoing session; Pi aborts it at teardown. Cost: one wasted
  model call and an aborted turn in the old transcript. Workspace safety is
  unaffected because shutdown still waits for worker quiescence.
- **Blocking shutdown.** Quit and session replacement wait for cancelled
  workers to actually stop. Cancellation is cooperative, so a worker whose
  provider or tool ignores the abort delays shutdown for as long as it runs.
  A visible status names the tickets being waited on.
- **Host-lifetime tickets.** Tickets and undelivered results do not survive
  `/reload` or session replacement. Durable recovery is a separate roadmap
  item, not part of this contract.
- **Current-leaf append.** A result that cannot wake its origin leaf is
  appended at whatever leaf is current when it settles, and enters model
  context there on the next turn.

## v2 intentionally may change

The rewrite may change without compatibility ceremony:

- module boundaries, internal interfaces, types, data structures, dependency
  injection, locking, scheduling, and concurrency implementation;
- cancellation detection, completion proofs, cleanup strategy, retry machinery,
  and all internal timeout values, provided the documented outcomes hold;
- ticket state representation, transition ownership, busy tracking, retention
  implementation, and delivery plumbing;
- session materialization and pooling architecture, including the v1
  policy/materialization module seam, provided reuse behavior remains compatible;
- isolated-workspace mechanics, including whether v2 uses temporary indexes,
  detached worktrees, refs, patches, or another recoverable transactional design;
- generated bundle layout and build plumbing;
- Pi-version adapters and host-compatibility checks;
- TUI component structure, refresh strategy, and non-semantic visual details;
- ticket identifier format, temporary directory names, and recovery artifact
  paths, provided identifiers remain opaque and artifacts remain discoverable;
- exact error/help/status prose, provided it stays actionable and does not lose
  a semantic distinction;
- telemetry tables and storage internals, provided existing data is migrated or
  explicitly versioned rather than silently lost;
- tests and test seams. V1 tests are evidence for behavior, not an API that v2
  must reproduce.

This contract does **not** pre-authorize changed defaults, removed normalization,
weaker cancellation or workspace guarantees, different ticket delivery,
different session persistence, or a broader extension trust boundary. Those
would be intentional public API changes, not implementation freedom.

## Test migration policy

Do **not** port the v1 test suite wholesale. Its regression knowledge is useful;
its decomposition is not a v2 contract. Before reimplementation, classify each
v1 test by purpose:

1. **Contract tests** cover behavior promised by `SPEC.md`: accepted calls,
   validation, results, sessions, tickets, workspaces, usage, and other
   caller-visible effects. Reimplement these against v2's public tool boundary.
2. **Regression tests** reproduce a real failure that could violate the public
   contract or an invariant. Preserve the scenario and expected outcome, but
   reimplement it through the public boundary rather than carrying over v1
   fixtures, mocks, call sequences, or helper assumptions.
3. **Internal tests** exist only to validate a v1 helper, module boundary,
   intermediate representation, private state transition, or decomposition.
   Delete them. Add new internal tests only when v2's own design warrants them.

Tests should assert observable results and effects: returned tool content,
ticket/session behavior, filesystem state, preserved user Git state, resource
availability, emitted usage, and actionable failure. They should not assert
which v1 helper was called, the shape of private state, exact internal event
ordering, or a particular cleanup/reconciliation mechanism.

The old suite is a source catalogue for discovering cases, not code to copy and
not a coverage target. Similar test counts, file names, fixtures, and line
coverage are explicitly not compatibility goals.
