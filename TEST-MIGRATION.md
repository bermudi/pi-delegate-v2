# V1 test migration

The v1 suite is evidence, not source material. Tests are rewritten against the
registered `delegate` tool; they do not import implementation helpers.

## Classification

- **Contract** — proves behavior promised by `SPEC.md`.
- **Regression** — preserves a previously observed public failure scenario.
- **Internal** — proves only v1 helper behavior, decomposition, private state,
  rendering implementation, or an exact algorithm. Do not migrate.

When one v1 test mixes categories, extract only the public scenario. Do not
copy its fixtures, mocks, call graph, or intermediate assertions.

## Conventions

- `pendingTest` (`tests/support/pending.ts`) marks a migrated test whose
  contract needs unimplemented subsystems. Pending tests compile and
  typecheck, list as `(todo)` under `bun test`, and run for real with
  `DELEGATE_RUN_PENDING=1 bun test`, where they are expected to **fail
  meaningfully** against the scaffold's not-implemented boundary. Promote a
  pending test to `test` when its subsystem lands — or earlier, if its
  assertions already hold (two were promoted in the second tranche).
- `callDelegateDetached` (`tests/support/pi-boundary.ts`) fires a delegate
  call without awaiting it inline, so a test can interrupt the in-flight
  call through the raw `AgentSession` the harness exposes
  (`session.session.abort()`) — the awaited `run` API cannot express this.
- `installSubagentModel` (`tests/support/pi-boundary.ts`) registers pi-ai's
  built-in `faux` provider on the test session's `modelRuntime` and **sets
  the parent session's model to it** — inline tasks inherit the parent's
  model, so unnamed test tasks exercise real inheritance and stream through
  the scripted provider (the harness playbook replaces the parent's own
  streamFn, so the parent itself never streams it). A second provider
  (`alt`) serves named-agent override proofs, configured through
  `models` entries; `configureDelegate(session, patch)` shallow-merges into
  the session's `delegate.json`. This encodes a testability assumption for
  v2: subagent model resolution and streaming must route through the parent
  session's model runtime/registry. If v2 ends up creating subagent sessions
  on a different runtime, update the support layer — not the tests.
- The harness session's `agentDir` is its temporary cwd, so
  `<cwd>/delegate.json` stands in for the user-global config file. Pi
  0.84.2 exposes no `agentDir` on `ExtensionContext` and the harness
  session is in-memory, so v2 resolves that cwd only as a *warned*
  fallback (#12): `openDelegateBoundary` therefore sets
  `DELEGATE_AGENT_DIR` to the session cwd — the explicit seam the warning
  recommends — keeping the suite on the env source and warning-clean.
  All bun test files share ONE process, so the env var is process-global;
  it is safe only under the suite's discipline: every test opens its
  session via openDelegateBoundary immediately before dispatching, one
  live session at a time, serially. Tests exercising the cwd fallback or
  the session-store layout save/delete/restore the variable around the
  call.
- Assertions target observable outcomes (result text/isError/details, ticket
  status wording, filesystem effects, provider call counts), never v1 prose
  or internal state. Exact ticket-id format and wording stay loose on
  purpose.

## Coverage map

### Parent conversation removal (#14)

- **Contract:** no parent transcript extraction/injection; obsolete `context`
  fields reject before any task starts, including `fresh`.
- **Covered now:** public schema omission; normal fresh child dispatch with no
  parent transcript reads or message injection; sync/async mixed-batch rejection; flat/stringified
  requests and invalid/null values get migration guidance (`dispatch.test.ts`).
  Existing `sessions.test.ts` proves child-owned pooled and explicit resume
  history still continues. Model inheritance tests remain unchanged.
- **Provenance:** user-directed v2 breaking removal, superseding the former
  parent-sharing contract test, not a migrated v1 implementation test.


Per subsystem: contract behaviors, regression scenarios carried forward,
internal-only v1 tests discarded, what v2 tests already represent, and known
gaps.

### Input recovery and mode validation

- **Contract:** four-mode selection after normalization; mode exclusivity;
  closed enums; batch validated before any task starts; actionable errors.
- **Regression:** stringified/flat/task-string normalization; task-level
  `async`/`sessionAction` silently degrading; `workspace:"none"` misparse;
  orphaned ticket fields producing help.
- **Internal:** direct calls to `normalizeDelegateArguments` /
  `validateDelegateOperation`; exact error wording; description-length
  budgets.
- **Covered now:** help for omitted/empty tasks; orphaned-field rejection;
  enum rejection; task-level control-field rejection; task-id charset;
  stringified/flat/tools recovery; ticket/session intent never folded into
  tasks; flat fields never merged into an explicit task array; duplicate
  task/session ids; non-positive `deadlineMs`; scratch/isolated +
  `sessionId`/`resumeFrom`; mixed-mode conflict errors; prompt-less task
  without resume; unknown agent guidance; required-field messages for
  ticket/session RPC; a task `model` field is rejected before any task
  starts with guidance toward the config; a named agent's `models` entry
  overrides the parent model for that agent (and inline tasks provably
  inherit the parent); a configured reference that does not resolve
  in the registry names the entry and the config file
  (`tests/contract/dispatch.test.ts`).
- **Gap:** none specific to model selection.

### Synchronous dispatch

- **Contract:** sync default; input-ordered per-task results; per-task
  outcomes; aggregate usage where the host supports it; caller task ids
  echoed for correlation.
- **Regression:** failed task does not fail siblings or destroy index
  alignment; partial output/usage/touched files preserved on failure.
- **Internal:** `formatCompletedTask`/`formatFailedTask` rendering, header
  markers, `fmt*`/`trunc*` helpers, touched-file extraction helpers.
- **Covered now:** ordered results; sibling failure isolation; task-id echo;
  aggregate usage on the tool result; parent-abort of an in-flight sync call
  settles as a structured cancellation (asserted in the cancellation
  regression suite via `callDelegateDetached` + raw-session `abort()`);
  deadline/stall outcomes visible in result text (cancellation suite);
  a sabotaged model-runtime grab (truthy impostor injected through the raw
  harness session) fails the whole call with the actionable error before any
  task starts (`tests/regression/host-runtime.test.ts`, issue #11).
- **Covered now (#13, v2 regression evidence):** throwing parent active-tool
  probes reject mixed sync/async batches before any child starts, preserving
  cause, guidance, and logging; explicit tools (including `[]`), built-in
  scout/coder/reviewer, and inline choices bypass the probe; successful
  restricted-parent mirroring retains read-only tools and preserves empty or
  unsupported-only inventories; a public extension's `setActiveTools(["delegate"])`
  restriction independently exercises the real host path (review 5722868479)
  (`tests/regression/parent-tools.test.ts`). Host-only injection in
  `tests/support/parent-tools.ts` targets Pi 0.84.2's extension runtime callback
  while retaining the wrapper's live inventory. Calls still use the registered
  delegate tool. The original AgentSession fault seam also broke the wrapper
  before delegate ran; its verifier commit is retained, with one explicitly
  user-authorized correction commit (#13 exception comment).
- **Gap:** overlap warnings on results.

### Multi-task / concurrent dispatch

- **Contract:** bounded global and per-model concurrency; order independent
  of completion order; queued tasks hold no execution resources.
- **Regression:** abort wakes queued tasks without waiting for a slot; a
  gated successor waits without holding a global slot.
- **Internal:** `mapConcurrent*` helpers; `reconfigureGlobalConcurrency`
  mechanics.
- **Covered now:** configured bound (`delegate.json` `maxConcurrent`) limits
  simultaneous subagent work (measured through the faux provider's live call
  tracking); the bound is re-read per call in both directions; a per-model
  bound (`concurrency.models`) serializes below the global limit; a task
  cancelled while queued behind the bound never reaches the provider.
- **Gap:** per-provider limit variants; abort-of-queued while parked behind
  a serialized writer.

### Async tickets

- **Contract:** `async: true` returns a ticket immediately; auto-delivery;
  poll roster and single-ticket views; wait blocks to settlement or timeout;
  tickets stay pollable after settlement; natural settlement is `completed`
  (every task ok), `partial` (at least one ok and at least one not),
  `cancelled` (all cancelled), or `failed` (none ok, at least one failed)
  while forced cancellation stays `cancelled`; a singular ticket RPC on an
  unknown id is a tool error while an empty roster poll succeeds.
- **Regression:** cancelled tickets retain partial results with index
  alignment; a late worker cannot flip a cancelled ticket to done; wait
  timeout/abort detaches only that waiter; delivery failure never unsettles.
- **Internal:** ticket id generation, TTL sweeping, roster/format string
  composition, busy-index internals, waiter plumbing.
- **Covered now:** empty roster; error-valued unknown-ticket handling for
  all singular actions; wait-to-settlement; timeout detach; cancel preview
  vs force; explicit `partial` mixed-batch and `failed` all-failure
  settlement; cancelled-ticket retains completed results; pause/resume.
- **Covered now (`tests/contract/delivery.test.ts`, `SPEC.md` "Background
  delivery"):** same-leaf follow-up wake of an idle parent (`deliverAs:
  "followUp"` + `triggerTurn: true`), including after a prior navigation;
  durable no-wake append plus "appended" notice after `/tree` navigation
  (`triggerTurn: false` — the custom message lands in the session at the
  current leaf); delivery held until isolated reconciliation applies and
  final annotations land; delivery failure (throw or async rejection) is
  logged/surfaced and leaves the ticket settled and pollable; failed and
  cancelled batches deliver their safe partial results; pause holds
  delivery until the whole batch finishes; `session_shutdown`
  force-cancels tickets, resolves waiters, performs no delivery, and holds
  until worker quiescence is actually confirmed and through the batch's
  finalization — when shutdown completes, the pollable view already
  carries the integration annotations, so a replacement session never
  starts into a tree the old batch is still reconciling; the visible
  waiting status names the awaited ticket id; new dispatches reject
  once shutdown begins while ticket RPCs still answer.
- **Gap:** delivered-result suppression when a waiter already consumed it;
  progress/onUpdate frames; roster wording details; replacement-session
  non-inheritance (no real session replacement is expressible through the
  harness — the emitted `session_shutdown` path is covered instead).

### Cancellation

- **Contract:** preview unless `force`; cooperative; never claims rollback or
  subprocess termination; cause precedence parent-abort > deadline > stall;
  cancelled work must still produce a caller-visible outcome; unsafe-to-clean
  resources stay quarantined.
- **Regression:** cancellation during prompt/turn produces structured
  cancellation (not provider-error text); completed writes survive.
- **Internal:** quiescence-barrier internals, unwind budgets, settle-path
  plumbing.
- **Covered now:** cancel preview/force and retained results; a task
  cancelled while queued behind the concurrency bound never starts; a task
  cancelled while paused between model turns does not start another
  provider call; a mid-stream abort is a structured cancellation, not an
  error, and no extra turn starts. Caller settlement is decoupled from
  worker wind-down: a forced cancel settles while a gated provider keeps
  cleanup blocked, a sync call returns a structured outcome when its
  deadline fires against a non-cooperative worker, conflicting work
  rejects while the quarantined worker may still mutate, and the
  reservation releases only after quiescence is actually confirmed.
  Parent-abort of an in-flight sync call settles with the `cancelled` cause
  (which outranks the task's unfired deadline) while the gated worker is
  still held — proven by driving `session.session.abort()` on the raw
  AgentSession mid-call. The stall cause: a worker silent past the
  `delegate.json` `stallTimeoutMs` budget settles as a structured stall
  (not a deadline, not a plain cancel) with its reservation retained until
  the gated worker winds down; parked time behind a paused ticket is not
  inactivity (the countdown freezes between turns), while a silent
  in-flight turn still stalls under a paused ticket.
- **Gap:** a worker whose abort is delivered
  but then completes "ok" anyway (the faux provider always honors a
  tripped signal once its gate releases, so the boundary cannot produce a
  late success — the abortReason guard is what keeps it cancelled);
  cancellation landing during child-session creation (no deterministic
  boundary seam for it).

### Pause / resume

- **Contract:** cooperative boundary between tasks and model turns; paused
  ticket stays running and keeps sessions, deadlines, and reservations.
- **Regression:** resume-then-repause cannot leak a waiting operation; a
  naturally final turn completes instead of parking; parked time is not
  inactivity while wall-clock deadlines still apply.
- **Internal:** checkpoint machinery, `Agent.subscribe` gating, parked
  listener bookkeeping.
- **Covered now:** pause holds queued work; paused ticket remains running;
  resume continues to settlement; parked time is not inactivity (the stall
  countdown freezes while parked and resumes with its remaining budget),
  and a silent in-flight turn still stalls under a paused ticket. v2 gates
  queued tasks before slot acquisition and parks between-turn continuations
  via the core `prepareNextTurnWithContext` hook.
- **Gap:** mid-turn pause semantics (current turn finishes); deadline-during-
  pause; pause unavailability on terminal tickets.

### Session reuse and lifecycle

- **Contract:** `sessionId` pools a live session for host lifetime; same-id
  serializes; frozen cwd/tools/thinking/model/base-prompt/extension config;
  insert-on-success; `resumeFrom` rehydrates and may then pool; `close`
  disposes; `list` reports live sessions; shutdown cleans up.
- **Regression:** frozen-config mismatch is an actionable rejection; missing
  `resumeFrom` transcript errors; busy sessions (including cancelling
  tickets) reject conflicting reuse; cancelled/stalled pooled sessions are
  evicted; pre-prompt deadline leaves the pooled session intact with no
  usage; late materialization after cancellation is never prompted or pooled.
- **Internal:** pool map/locks, config cloning, quarantine registry, session
  file bookkeeping.
- **Covered now:** pool + list + continuation on reuse; `close` removes and
  a later call starts fresh; frozen-config mismatch rejects with an
  actionable error; a pooled session whose agent's configured model changed
  between calls rejects the same way (model freeze compares resolved models);
  a pooled session cancelled mid-reuse is evicted and the
  next call starts fresh (busy `close` also rejected in-flight); `close` on
  an unknown session errors; missing-transcript `resumeFrom` error; a
  `sessionId` held by a running ticket rejects conflicting reuse;
  `resumeFrom` without a prompt rehydrates the transcript and sends the
  default continuation instruction (live test with a real `.jsonl`
  fixture); empty `sessionId` rejected.
- **Gap:** eviction after stalled/deadline-exceeded runs; shutdown cleanup;
  usage recorded for ordinary failures on pooled sessions; pre-prompt
  deadline leaving the session intact.

### Admission and shared writes

- **Contract:** fail closed on ambiguous Git/cwd scope; canonical equal /
  ancestor / descendant roots overlap; `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`,
  `web_search` are read-only; unknown tools count as mutating; same-call
  overlapping writers serialize in task order; overlap with active or
  quarantined work rejects; shared/isolated overlap rejects; operator-only
  warned bypass.
- **Regression:** symlink canonicalization; inherited `GIT_DIR`/
  `GIT_COMMON_DIR`/`core.worktree` redirection fails closed with bash-capable
  writers; nested repositories reject; path-prefix siblings are not nested;
  a predecessor failure does not block a serialized successor.
- **Internal:** `findSharedWriteConflicts` grouping internals, canonical-path
  helpers.
- **Covered now:** same-call writer serialization order; cross-call
  rejection against a running ticket; shared + isolated same-call rejection;
  an inherited `GIT_DIR` redirect fails closed for a bash-capable
  multi-writer batch; the scope probe runs with `GIT_*` scrubbed so a bogus
  redirect cannot shrink the reserved scope.
- **Gap:** read-only + writer parallelism allowed; unknown-but-real tools
  treated as mutating; symlink canonicalization; external `core.worktree`
  dual-root reservation; operator bypass warning surfaces; scratch
  suggestion in rejection prose.

### Scratch workspaces

- **Contract:** one-shot; disposable copy; changes discarded; no `sessionId`
  or `resumeFrom`; relative-write protection only; actionable setup-failure
  remedy; read-only tasks rejected; no source write reservation.
- **Regression:** stale-copy sweep (pid-namespaced, dead pids collected);
  linked-worktree rejection (a `.git` file redirects Git into the real
  repository); setup failure appends the `workspace:"shared"` remedy.
  V1's symlink-escape rejection is deliberately dropped — scratch is not a
  sandbox, and stores like pnpm/bun make escaping links common; links are
  preserved verbatim instead.
- **Internal:** lease layout/markers, sweep mechanics, copy strategy.
- **Covered now:** discarded mutations never reach the source tree;
  read-only tasks reject before any provider call; a linked worktree
  rejects with the shared/isolated remedy; a scratch task does not
  conflict with an overlapping shared writer; copies from dead processes
  are swept; copies land under the agent dir, never beside the source.
- **Gap:** nested repositories whose `.git` files use absolute gitdirs
  (accepted risk: an ordinary copy preserves them, and scratch is not a
  security boundary).

### Isolated workspaces

- **Contract:** one-shot Git isolation; baseline (dirty/untracked) and the
  user's index/branch preserved; task-order all-or-nothing reconciliation;
  conflicts and pre-apply cancellation retain recoverable artifacts;
  `applied_unverified` never claims correctness; worker activity ends before
  output is accepted.
- **Regression:** source changed mid-execution refuses apply; failed workers
  are discarded; abandoned workers are never snapshotted or applied;
  proposals with no changes leave nothing behind.
- **Internal:** temporary-index strategy, private refs, patch representation,
  candidate-worktree mechanics.
- **Covered now:** ordered apply of two proposals with `applied_unverified`
  wording; conflict retains artifacts without clobbering a human edit while
  an independent proposal still applies.
- **Gap:** cancellation before apply retains proposals and applies nothing;
  binary/symlink/mode reconciliation; baseline-drift refusal; worker-process
  termination guarantees.

### Failure propagation and retries

- **Contract:** transient failures may retry; model/account failures do not
  blindly retry on the same model and hint at a different model; exhausted
  retries return the last error; validation failure starts no tasks.
- **Regression:** retry accounting stays aligned on abort during backoff;
  observed bash activity suppresses whole-task retry; result text preserves
  the model-swap hint.
- **Internal:** `isModelAttributableError`, retry-gating internals, backoff
  timing.
- **Covered now:** transient retry to success; model-attributable no-retry +
  model hint; serialized successor after predecessor failure; batch
  validation starts nothing; the `deadlineMs` budget is shared across
  attempts and the retry backoff (a deadline shorter than the backoff
  prevents the second attempt entirely).
- **Gap:** retry-count visibility in results; stall structured outcomes;
  no-retry-after-side-effects (needs a mutating tool before a transient
  failure).

### Telemetry and observable events

- **Contract:** usage on synchronous results; async delivered results never
  add usage; telemetry is fail-open and never stores prompt/output content;
  externally visible signals (ticket roster/poll text, status surfaces) stay
  meaningful.
- **Internal:** SQLite layout, sweep cadence, record-once mechanics — all
  free to change; only privacy and outcome-meaning are contract.
- **Covered now:** aggregate usage present on the sync tool result;
  telemetry is disabled by default and creates no file; explicit opt-in
  writes call/task rows carrying only the allowed metadata with legacy
  privacy columns NULL; `telemetry.dbPath` > `DELEGATE_TELEMETRY_DB` >
  `<agentDir>/delegate-usage.db` precedence; open/write failure is
  fail-open and leaves dispatch results intact; DB/WAL/SHM files are
  owner-only; a v1 database migrates in place preserving existing rows;
  simultaneous first-open writers each persist exactly one call and one
  task row per batch; malformed telemetry config rejects before provider work;
  force-cancelled calls record authoritative cancellation; a failed destination
  retries after the identity changes; isolated integration status records only
  after reconciliation; an unfinished span is dropped when the destination
  changes before its batch finishes; task rows whose workers have unconfirmed
  quiescence are marked provisional.
- **Gap:** async-no-usage property; TUI/status rendering is
  intentionally out of scope for boundary tests.

### Agent directory resolution

- **Contract:** the user-global agent directory resolves from
  `DELEGATE_AGENT_DIR` when set, else Pi's session-store layout
  (`<agentDir>/sessions/<slug>`), else the session cwd. Pi 0.84.2 exposes
  no `agentDir` on `ExtensionContext`; when it does (earendil-works/pi#4807),
  the inference and the fallback are deleted.
- **Regression (#12):** the cwd fallback — taken by embedded/in-memory
  hosts — must not be silent: it warns once per extension instance before
  the first dispatch, naming the directory, `delegate.json`, the
  `delegate-*` trees that may be created under it, and the
  `DELEGATE_AGENT_DIR` escape hatch; the call itself proceeds (warn, not
  reject). A file-backed session under `<agentDir>/sessions/` resolves to
  that agent dir via the "session" source with no warning.
- **Internal:** the provenance tuple shape and the warning latch are free
  to change; only warn-once-then-proceed and source precedence are
  contract.
- **Covered now:** `tests/regression/agent-dir-fallback.test.ts`.
  `tests/regression/boundary-isolation.test.ts` covers the v2 review
  regression: overlapping harness sessions keep configuration reads and
  pooled transcript writes in their own directories without changing the
  process environment.
- **Gap:** none.

### Explicit dispatch identity (#16)

- **Contract:** `operationId` scopes a dispatch to one execution per live
  key+request: the same normalized `{async, tasks}` reuses the in-flight
  promise or settled result (sync result or async ticket), a changed
  request conflicts before any work, retention is bounded (one-hour
  expiry, 256 settled records, in-flight never evicted), the first caller
  owns cancellation/context/progress/delivery, and unkeyed dispatches are
  never deduplicated. Host-lifetime only; no crash or exactly-once claim.
- **Regression:** concurrent retries share one gated execution; a
  duplicate caller's aborted signal cannot cancel the shared operation;
  post-settlement retries reuse; same-id changed requests conflict while
  running and after settlement; forced-cancel results are reused, never
  restarted; an in-flight async operation survives settled-cap pressure
  and retries to the same ticket; expiry and capacity eviction permit
  fresh operations; intentional unkeyed repeats always execute;
  equivalent supported normalizations (flat task vs one-task array,
  batch workspace default vs task workspace) count as identical.
- **Internal:** the map, the fingerprint hash (SHA-256 today), and prune
  mechanics are free to change; only the identity semantics and bounds
  are contract.
- **Covered now:** `tests/contract/operations.test.ts`, including
  failed-result reuse after the configuration that caused the failure is
  fixed, alongside forced-cancel result reuse.
- **Gap:** none.

## Third tranche (foundational execution/lifecycle implementation)

The scaffold boundary was replaced by a real implementation under `src/`:
`validation.ts` (mode/semantic checks), `host.ts` (task resolution +
subagent `AgentSession` construction through the parent's `ModelRuntime`),
`admission.ts` (workspace/session reservations), `coordinator.ts`
(scheduling, bounded concurrency, index-aligned outcomes), `execution.ts`
(one `AgentSession` per attempt, cooperative abort), `tickets.ts` (guarded
ticket lifecycle + RPCs), `retry.ts` (retry classification), `config.ts`
(`delegate.json`), `profiles.ts` (built-in agent profiles).

Semantic decisions recorded during implementation:

- Ticket terminal status: all-ok → `completed`; all-failed → `failed`;
  mixed → `completed` with per-task statuses retained. A forced
  `cancelled` is authoritative immediately; late worker outcomes are
  recorded for visibility but can never change the status.
- Whole-task retry is bounded (max 2 attempts), applies only to clearly
  transient errors, and never replays a task that produced side effects or
  owns a `sessionId`/`resumeFrom`.
- Pause parks queued tasks before slot acquisition and parks in-flight
  tasks between model turns via `prepareNextTurnWithContext`; a paused
  ticket keeps its reservations.
- `wait` timeout or caller abort detaches only that waiter.
- Stall is an inactivity watchdog fed by session events (`delegate.json`
  `stallTimeoutMs`, default 15min, 0 disables). It settles a task as failed
  with stall wording — distinct from deadline and operator cancellation —
  freezes while a worker is parked between turns, and evicts a pooled
  session after a prompted run the same way a deadline does.
- Subagent sessions are extension-free, in-memory-transcript, and stream
  through the parent `ModelRuntime` (reached via `modelRegistry.runtime`,
  a private-field seam that fails loudly if upstream changes it).
- Known harness quirk: a schema-level rejection never calls
  `tool.execute`, so the synthesized `tool_execution_end` record is the
  only result evidence — and the harness dedupes it by a playbook
  `toolCallId` that repeats across `session.run` calls on one session.
  Tests asserting a schema rejection therefore need a fresh session per
  malformed call.

Promoted to live tests: all of `dispatch.test.ts` (6), `tickets.test.ts`
(7), `validation.test.ts` semantic tests (8), `failure-propagation.test.ts`
(3 pending), the first three `workspaces.test.ts` admission cases, and the
`resumeFrom` + busy-ticket cases in `sessions.test.ts`.

## Fourth tranche (adversarial correctness review)

Public-boundary regression tests added for defects found in review:

- `tests/regression/cancellation.test.ts` — queued-behind-bound cancellation
  never reaches the provider; paused-between-turns cancellation starts no
  further call; mid-stream abort is a cancellation, not an error.
- `tests/contract/dispatch.test.ts` — the configured bound now actually
  limits (read-only tools keep writers out of serialization); the bound is
  re-read per call in both directions; a `concurrency.models` per-model
  bound serializes below the global limit. The former parent-transcript
  injection test is superseded by the deliberate #14 removal below.
- `tests/contract/workspaces.test.ts` — `GIT_DIR` redirect +
  bash-capable multi-writer batch fails closed; the Git scope probe
  scrubs inherited `GIT_*`.
- `tests/regression/failure-propagation.test.ts` — `deadlineMs` is one
  wall-clock budget across attempts and backoff.
- `tests/contract/sessions.test.ts` — `resumeFrom` without a prompt sends
  the default continuation instruction over the rehydrated transcript.

## Fifth tranche (caller settlement vs worker quiescence)

The investigation confirmed a real indefinite-settlement defect: Pi's
`session.abort()` waits for `waitForIdle()`, and the agent loop's
provider-stream and tool awaits do not race the abort signal — so a
non-cooperative provider/tool left `prompt()` pending forever and a
synchronous dispatch never returned (proven by a test that timed out at 5s
on the pre-fix implementation; it now returns at the task's deadline).

The lifecycle now separates three concepts in `TaskExecution`:

- **caller settlement** (`result()`): resolves with the true outcome when
  the run winds down, or a provisional cancelled/deadline outcome the
  moment cancellation is requested — never blocked on cleanup;
- **worker truth** (`settled()`): resolves only when `prompt()` +
  `waitForIdle()` actually settle — confirmed quiescence;
- **resource eligibility**: provisional outcomes are `quarantined`, so the
  grant retains their reservations at call end; when `settled()` later
  confirms quiescence (`quarantined: false`), `grant.releaseRetained`
  frees them. A worker that never settles keeps them for process life.

New regression tests in `tests/regression/cancellation.test.ts`:

- forced cancel settles while a gated provider blocks cleanup, conflicting
  work rejects during quarantine, the reservation releases only after the
  worker demonstrably winds down, and the ticket stays cancelled;
- a sync call returns a structured deadline outcome while the worker is
  still gated, holds the reservation during quarantine, and admits the
  same scope once quiescence is confirmed.

## Sixth tranche (isolated workspaces)

`src/isolated.ts` implements `workspace: "isolated"` end to end. Each call
captures one synthetic baseline commit per Git source root — tracked,
deleted, and untracked content snapshot via a temporary index, so the
user's real index and branch never move — then runs each task in a
detached worktree created from that baseline. After execution, successful
workers' trees are snapshotted to private refs and full `--binary` patch
files under `<agentDir>/delegate-isolated/<batch>/`, and reconciliation
applies each accepted proposal to the source in task order via
`git apply --check` + `git apply --binary`. Per-proposal application means
a drifted/conflicting proposal is retained with its ref/patch/worktree
while later independent proposals still apply; an aborted or failed apply
restores expected pre-apply content from the pre-image and preserves
recovery artifacts. Cancellation before source apply retains proposals
instead of applying them; quarantined workers are discarded (never
snapshotted) and their worktrees/refs are retained until quiescence is
confirmed, with deferred cleanup through `releaseRetained`.

Lifecycle wiring: `delegate.ts` admits reservations, prepares workspaces,
then runs the coordinator with a `finalize` hook so reconciliation
completes inside the reservation window; tickets hold caller-visible
settlement (`holdSettlement`) until reconcile finishes while forced
cancellation still settles immediately — its proposals are then retained,
never applied. `TaskOutcome.integration` records per-task
`applied_unverified` / `conflict` / `retained` / `discarded` /
`no_changes` / `apply_failed` detail rendered in both the sync result
block and ticket views.

Promoted to live tests: ordered reconciliation and conflict retention in
`tests/contract/workspaces.test.ts`. The conflict test gates the first
worker's provider response so the source drift lands deterministically
between baseline capture and reconciliation; `gitInit` now creates an
initial commit since isolated baselines require `HEAD`. The
unimplemented-modes test now covers only `scratch`.

Steering additions in the same tranche (observed failure: a five-task
same-repo shared batch serialized into an hour-plus pipeline when the
tasks were independent and `isolated` was the right call):

- A batch-level `workspace` field defaults every task that does not name
  its own — `delegate({ workspace: "isolated", tasks: [...] })` is the
  one-field spelling of parallel same-repo edits. It is rejected when
  orphaned on ticket/session operations.
- Schema descriptions and the help manual now carry the decision rule:
  `shared` serializes overlapping same-repo writers in task order;
  `isolated` runs independent edits in parallel and merges in order.
- Admission exposes `serialized` groups on the grant; results prepend a
  notice naming the serialized tasks and scope with the isolated remedy
  (sync: live `onUpdate` frame plus the final result; async: ticket
  creation text and poll/wait views).

New live tests: the serialization test asserts the notice and remedy; a
batch-default test proves parallel isolated execution and source
reconciliation; an override test proves a task-level `shared` still wins
and therefore rejects against isolated siblings.

A fresh-context review pass then hardened the lifecycle edges:

- `runOne` can no longer reject: a `runTask` throw is converted to a failed
  outcome — quarantined only when a worker session may exist (a loader
  rejection is provably pre-worker). `Promise.all` cannot reject while
  siblings still run, `finalize` always executes, and reservations are
  never released mid-write by a sibling fault.
- Serialized successors now gate on the predecessor's *confirmed*
  quiescence, not its caller-visible record — a provisional quarantined
  predecessor may still be mutating the shared root.
- `markGroupFailure` no longer rewrites already-terminal integrations
  (`applied_unverified`, `discarded`) as `apply_failed`.
- Aborted `--check`/snapshot operations report `retained`, not a
  source-drift `conflict` or `apply_failed`.
- An empty chain delta (identical earlier proposal) is `applied_unverified`
  — `git apply` rejects empty input.
- Apply rollback restores only the delta's touched paths, not the
  proposal's whole file list.
- The artifact root is excluded from baseline snapshots when it lives
  inside the source tree, so retained artifacts and live worktrees cannot
  leak into a baseline or a later proposal.
- Top-level `sessionId` combined with `tasks` is rejected instead of
  silently ignored; cleanup no longer issues `update-ref -d` for
  never-created proposal refs.

## Seventh tranche (pooled sessions)

`src/sessions.ts` implements `sessionId` pooling, `sessionAction` RPCs, and
shutdown. The pool is owned by the extension closure; admission's
busy-session marks already serialize same-ID calls across acquisition,
execution, and state update, so no second locking layer exists.

- **Checkout/reuse:** `TaskExecution` checks the pool before creating a
  session. A hit means no creation and no pre-prompt abort — the session is
  quiescent by definition. The between-turn pause hook
  (`prepareNextTurnWithContext`) is restored at run end so a reused session
  carries no stale controls, and per-run usage is diffed against the
  session's cumulative stats.
- **Durable transcripts:** `sessionId` tasks create a file-backed
  `SessionManager` under `<agentDir>/delegate-sessions/`; `resumeFrom`
  transcripts are already durable. Insert-on-success requires the file to
  exist.
- **Frozen config:** cwd, tools (order-independent), thinking, model, and
  base prompt are compared against the resolved task. `validateReuse` runs
  before admission so a mismatch fails the whole call; `checkout`
  re-verifies so a close-and-recreate race degrades to a task failure.
  `resumeFrom` on an already-live sessionId rejects.
- **Settle policy:** ok+prompted keeps/inserts; prompted cancel or deadline
  evicts; pre-prompt cancel/deadline leaves the session intact; ordinary
  failure keeps a pooled session reusable; quarantined sessions are evicted
  but never disposed.
- **RPC:** `list` shows live entries (running marked); `close` rejects
  busy/missing sessions, otherwise removes, aborts, and disposes.
- **Shutdown:** `session_shutdown` closes the pool to new reuse, requests
  termination of checked-out sessions (their runs own disposal through
  settle), disposes idle ones, and logs every cleanup failure.

Promoted to live tests: pool + list + continuation, close-then-fresh, and
frozen-config rejection in `tests/contract/sessions.test.ts`; the
tool-boundary scaffold assertion now expects the real `list` roster.

## Eighth tranche (scratch workspaces)

`src/scratch.ts` implements `workspace: "scratch"` end to end. Each scratch
task gets its own copy of its source tree — the Git top-level when the cwd
sits in an ordinary repository (the copied `.git` keeps Git commands
contained), otherwise the cwd itself — created with `cp -a --reflink=auto`
and a `fs.cp` verbatim-symlink fallback for non-GNU cp. Task cwds are
remapped into the copy before dispatch; copies live under
`<agentDir>/delegate-scratch/pid-<pid>/<batch>/`, never beside the source.

Semantic decisions recorded during implementation:

- **Read-only tasks reject.** A task whose resolved tools are all
  read-only cannot use scratch: the copy buys nothing and the failure
  teaches the caller. `scout + bash` stays legal — bash can dirty the
  tree, which is exactly what scratch contains.
- **Linked worktrees and submodules reject before copying.** A `.git`
  file at the source root redirects Git into another repository, so
  commands inside the copy would mutate the real repository's metadata —
  the one escape an ordinary relative write cannot take. The error names
  the `shared`/`isolated` remedies. This check is a stat, not a paid
  copy — the v1 failure mode of discovering this after copying is gone.
- **Symlink escapes are preserved, not rejected.** V1 refused links
  pointing outside the copy, which made scratch deterministically useless
  on pnpm/bun-style layouts. Scratch is not a security boundary
  (`SPEC.md`); reading through a link is not an ordinary relative write.
- **No fallback to shared.** Scratch's whole value is containment; an
  actionable error is the fallback path, and the preflight makes it cheap.
- **No source reservation.** Scratch tasks never write the source via
  relative paths, so they hold no admission reservation — a scratch task
  runs alongside an overlapping shared writer.
- **Cleanup is quiescence-gated.** `finalize` discards copies of
  confirmed-quiescent workers; a quarantined worker's copy is retained
  until `cleanupWorker` sees confirmed quiescence. Copies from dead
  processes are swept on the next scratch preparation in any session.
- `finalize`/`dispose` never throw — cleanup failure is litter, not an
  outcome change; it is logged.

Promoted to live tests: the scratch-discard contract test. New live tests:
read-only rejection, linked-worktree rejection with remedy, no
shared/scratch reservation conflict, dead-process sweep, and a non-Git
cwd copy.

## Ninth tranche (no caller model selection)

Tasks no longer select models at all. The task `model` field is rejected
whole-call with guidance toward the config. Model assignment is
user-only and inheritance-first: inline tasks and the `default` profile
mirror the parent's model unconditionally — there is no `default` config
entry, and `models.default` is rejected at load. Only a named agent may be
overridden, via its entry under `"models"` in the user-global `delegate.json`
(object: agent name → reference). Recorded as a deliberate breaking change
in `COMPATIBILITY.md` with migration guidance. This supersedes the interim
allowlist design from earlier in the same tranche (which briefly had a
configurable `default` — the wrong knob: inheritance is the invariant).

- `src/config.ts` parses and validates the `models` map — keys must name a
  known non-default agent (typos fail at load, and `default` is rejected
  with an explanation), values non-empty trimmed references — and resolves
  per task: agent entry → parent model, with inline/default never consulting
  config at all.
- `src/validation.ts` rejects any task `model` field before tasks start;
  the schema keeps the key so the rejection is a targeted, teachable error
  instead of a generic unknown-property failure.
- `src/host.ts` resolves the configured reference through the registry; a
  configured-but-unresolvable entry fails the whole call naming the entry
  and config path.
- The model-failure recovery hint addresses the operator (reconfigure
  delegate.json), not the caller (which has no model recourse).
- Test support: `installSubagentModel` sets the parent session's model to
  the faux provider (inline tasks inherit it for real) and installs a
  second faux provider (`alt`) for override proofs; every task input across
  the suites dropped its `model` field.
- New live tests: task `model` field rejection (nothing starts); a named
  agent's entry overrides the parent model while inline tasks provably
  inherit it (two providers show which served each task);
  configured-but-unresolvable entry rejection; a pooled session whose
  agent's configured model changed between calls rejects as a frozen-config
  mismatch (`tests/contract/sessions.test.ts`).

## Next contract slices

Done: mode exclusivity and validation failures; batch-before-start
validation and input-ordered results; ticket lifecycle, wait, cancellation,
and pause; persistent session reuse, frozen configuration, close, and
shutdown; shared-write admission and same-call serialization; isolated
all-or-nothing application; cancellation safety and quarantine; background
delivery on the stock Pi extension API (issue #3; `SPEC.md` "Background
delivery", `tests/contract/delivery.test.ts`) — no Pi patch was added to
`patches/`; opt-in content-free local telemetry with privacy exclusions and
v1 migration preservation (issue #8; `SPEC.md` "Telemetry",
`tests/contract/telemetry.test.ts`); bounded duplicate-safe dispatch
identity via `operationId` (issue #16; `SPEC.md` "Explicit operation
identity", `tests/contract/operations.test.ts`).

Remaining:

1. Usage properties.
2. The per-subsystem **Gap** entries above.

Each slice should add only the public test driver capabilities it needs. Tests
must not introduce public exports solely to reach private v2 state.
