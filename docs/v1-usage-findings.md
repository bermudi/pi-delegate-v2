# v1 `delegate` usage analysis: which patterns models get wrong

Empirical study of every `delegate` tool call in the v1 era, run to inform v2
design. Evidence, not contract — SPEC/INVARIANTS/COMPATIBILITY remain
authoritative.

## Corpus & method

- Source: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/*/*.jsonl`, 1,841 files scanned (3.1 GB),
  464 files contain delegate calls. **2,128 delegate tool calls**
  (2026-07-22 → 2026-09-25), 2,123 with joined results.
- **Contract eras.** v1 evolved under the models' feet. Calls before
  2026-08-15 (commit `2ce7651`, "Remove legacy action compatibility") ran an
  older contract in which top-level flat task fields, task-level `action`,
  and `action:"wait"` + `timeoutMs` were *legal*. Split: 1,164 old-era /
  964 modern-era. All difficulty findings below are modern-era only.
- **Two rejection channels.** This is the study's biggest methodological
  finding. Failures surface as (a) Pi-thrown schema validation errors with
  `isError=true` — only 19 — and (b) in-tool corrective rejections
  ("Invalid delegate call: …") delivered as *normal results* with
  `isError=false` — 52. Counting only `isError` undercounts failures by 3x.
  Real failure count: **71 calls (3.3% overall; 6.1% of modern-era calls)**.
- **Weighting.** Per bermudi: Tier A (gpt-5.6 family, gpt-6, glm-5.3,
  opus-5, fable-5, grok-4.5, kimi-k3, qwen3.8-max, muse-spark-1.3) ×1.0;
  Tier B ×0.5; Tier C (flash/free variants) ×0.25. Raw counts given
  alongside everywhere; rankings weight Tier A first.
- Classification: field-level extraction with jq/bun scripts (kept
  ephemeral in /tmp; method reproducible from this document), never raw
  transcript dumps. No prompt content is quoted in this report; examples are
  cited by `session-file:line`.

## Model league table (modern era, raw)

| Tier | Model | Calls | Failures | Rate |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A | gpt-5.6-sol | 468 | 8 | **1.7%** |
| A | glm-5.3 | 155 | 35 | **22.6%** |
| A | gpt-6-astra | 53 | 0 | 0.0% |
| C | glm-5.3-flash | 42 | 4 | 9.5% |
| C | muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free | 42 | 0 | 0.0% |
| C | muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free | 40 | 0 | 0.0% |
| A | meta/muse-spark-1.3-contributor | 34 | 0 | 0.0% |
| A | gpt-5.6-luna | 24 | 2 | 8.3% |
| A | gpt-5.6-terra | 23 | 2 | 8.7% |
| B | muse-spark-1.2-contributor | 22 | 1 | 4.5% |
| C | zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash | 16 | 0 | 0.0% |
| A | gpt-6-sol | 13 | 0 | 0.0% |
| C | qwen3.8-flash | 11 | 4 | 36.4% |
| C | hy3-free | 8 | 1 | 12.5% |
| B | zai-org/GLM-5.3 | 3 | 2 | 66.7% |

Headline: **glm-5.3 is the Tier-A outlier** — 13x the failure rate of
gpt-5.6-sol, which carried 49% of all modern traffic across 100+ varied
sessions. Tier-C small models with non-trivial volume are clean
(muse-spark-*-free 0%), so "small model" ≠ "misuses delegate"; shape
confusion is model-specific, not size-specific.

## Failure taxonomy (ranked by weighted impact)

### 1. Ticket/session control glued onto a dispatch ("kitchen-sink") — 25 failures, all GLM-family

`{ticketAction:"wait", sessionId, tasks:[…], sessionAction:"list", timeoutMs,
async…}` in one call. glm-5.3: 22 rejections, glm-5.3-flash 2, qwen3.8-flash 1.
Worst case: one glm-5.3 session (`--home-daniel-build-agent-extensions--/
2026-09-03T03-55-58…jsonl`, lines 12–132) failed **17/17 delegate calls**,
re-issuing the same kitchen-sink combo with minor variations 15 consecutive
times.

Attribution: **shared**. The contract is exclusive-mode and the error text
names the fix ("call it separately"), which models read and apply — but the
tool *description* never says modes are mutually exclusive, and nothing in
the schema signals that `ticketAction` changes the meaning of every other
field. Models that batch aggressively reach for one call that does
everything.

### 2. `timeoutMs` on a synchronous dispatch — 13 rejections

sol 4x, glm-5.3 6x, glm-5.3-flash 2x, qwen3.8-flash 1x:
"timeoutMs is valid only with ticketAction 'wait'". Another 14 old-era
`action:"wait"` uses were legal then and excluded.

Attribution: **tool-invited**. Dispatch blocks until completion and offers no
way to bound the wait; `timeoutMs` exists in the schema (for ticket `wait`)
so models reach for it where it's most wanted. Highest-value single fix in
v2.

### 3. Invented/unresolvable `model` names in tasks — 6 throws

`'sonnet'`, `'sol'`, `'deepseek-v4-bogus-nonsense'`,
`'nonexistent/fake-model-9000'`, `'modal/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash'` and
`'…:max'`. Committed by opus-5 and gpt-5.6-luna too. Meanwhile v1 *allowed*
task-level `model` (79 modern uses) and it usually resolved fine.

Attribution: **model-caused** (inventing registry names), and direct
empirical support for v2's decision to reject the task `model` field
entirely.

### 4. Task-level control fields — `async`, `timeoutMs`, legacy `action` inside task entries — ~11 modern failures + silent shims

Schema comment folklore confirmed: task-level `async: true` was submitted in
the wild (glm-5.3, stitch session L124–126) believing work was backgrounded
when it ran synchronously. Pre-Aug-15, task-level `action` was legal and
models used it heavily (112 entries, mostly `action:"prompt"`); post-Aug-15
it becomes a rejection. Old habits persist: ~9 task-level `action` entries
appear after the cutoff.

Attribution: **model-caused**, with an era-confusion assist from long-lived
sessions/context.

### 5. Malformed JSON payload — 5 failures, structural

`tasks` as a stringified array (3, incl. one with a leading newline that
defeated the recovery shim), plus one gpt-5.6-sol call emitting corrupted
tokens as field names (`toolsigeria`, `workspace RadiusBEL Relay` —
little-goblin session L378). Even flagship models occasionally mangle
large-JSON emission.

### 6. Output-token truncation of arguments — 2 failures

glm-5.3 hit the assistant-turn output limit mid-`tasks` twice consecutively
(collie session L290, L292). Prompts are long (modern p50 ≈ 583 chars, p90 ≈
2,715, max 9,608); multi-task dispatches with long prompts can exceed the
turn budget. Structural: no error message can fix a truncated call.

### 7. Field mix-ups — rare but vivid

One gpt-5.6-luna call pasted an entire review prompt into the `thinking`
field (caught by enum validation, VitaShell session L35). Bad enum values
for `workspace`/`thinking` total 3. `deadlineMs <= 0`: 16 silent-shape hits,
mostly old-era glm-5.3.

### 8. Benign habits the shims absorb — no errors, but real model confusion

`agent:""` (15 modern, 14 from muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free), `tools` as
string (21, mostly old-era glm-5.3), flat task fields with no `tasks` array
(5 modern — zai-org/GLM-5.3 3x), `tasks: []` help probes (10, mostly
first-contact test sessions). The shims silently recovered all of these with
no downstream failures — a design that worked.

## Behavioral findings

- **Models don't poll tickets.** 143 modern async dispatches; 97 were
  ever followed by a `ticketAction`, 46 never were. Of the 46 never managed,
  78% were *not* session-end fire-and-forget — the model moved on. v1's
  auto-delivery carried the load; v2 must not depend on models polling.
- Control usage (modern): `wait` 63 > `poll` 29 > `cancel` 2 >
  `sessionAction:list` 19. **`pause`, `resume`, `sessionAction:close`: zero
  uses in two months.** Dead surface that costs description tokens and
  (per finding #1) invites kitchen-sink confusion.
- `context: "with-parent-transcript"`: 2 of 694. Models respect the
  fresh-context default; the expensive option is avoided without coercion.
- `thinking: "high"` dominates (728/836 task-level uses); xhigh 38, max 11.
- Multi-task dispatch is used heavily: 1 task 43%, 2 tasks 11%, 3+ tasks
  14% of modern calls (rest: control calls). Task options are used
  heavily too: agent 1,295, id 1,222, cwd 985, workspace 895, deadlineMs
  377, resumeFrom 44.
- **Recovery is strong.** Of 71 failures: 57 corrected within the next two
  delegate calls (often a "staircase" — fix one field per attempt, e.g.
  stitch L122→124→126→128 ends in success), 9 identical retries (all in the
  glm-5.3 pathology session), 5 gave up. v1's corrective error messages
  demonstrably work; the two-channel rejection design did not impair model
  recovery.

## What v1 already got right (keep in v2)

1. Errors as corrective text results, naming the field and the fix.
2. Silent lossless recovery shims (stringified `tasks`, `tools` as string,
   `agent: ""`, flat-field wrapping) — zero downstream errors observed.
3. Auto-delivery of async results — models will not poll reliably.
4. Loud rejection of unknown task fields (the `async`-in-task trap).
5. `context: fresh` default — adopted universally without prompting.

## v2 recommendations (ranked)

1. **Give dispatch a way to bound its wait** — accept `timeoutMs` on
   dispatch (snapshot on timeout) or state "dispatch cannot be interrupted;
   use async + wait" in the description. Kills failure family #2 outright.
2. **State mode exclusivity in the tool description**, not only in errors:
   "one operation per call — dispatch tasks OR ticket control OR session
   control." Cheap tokens, directly targets the #1 family.
3. **Reject the task `model` field** (already spec'd) — validated by data:
   every model-name failure was an invented or mis-scoped name.
4. **Cut or hide `pause`/`resume`/`sessionAction:close`** — zero uses in two
   months; their description surface contributes to kitchen-sink confusion.
5. **Add a payload-size hint to the manual** ("split large multi-task
   dispatches across calls; keep arguments well under the output-token
   budget") — truncation is unrecoverable by error messages.
6. Keep everything in "What v1 got right" exactly as is.

## Caveats

- Single-user corpus (the extension's target user — findings describe the
  real deployment distribution, not the model population at large).
- Runtime build drift within the modern era is not controlled per-session;
  a few "failures" in August sessions hit pre-hardening builds, and some
  old-era habits were counted only when re-emitted post-cutoff.
- gpt-5.6-sol's 468-call sample spans 100+ projects; glm-5.3's 155 calls are
  concentrated in fewer sessions — its 22.6% rate is robust (failures in 10
  distinct sessions) but per-session variance is high.
- Classification is prefix/heuristic-based on extracted fields; the raw
  extracted dataset was ephemeral (/tmp), this document is the record.
